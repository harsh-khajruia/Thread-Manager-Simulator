# 🧵 Harsh Khajruia Thread Manager Simulator

A Python-based simulation tool to visualize and understand multithreading and synchronization using an interactive GUI.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to simulate the creation, execution, and synchronization of multiple threads. It offers both a **Graphical User Interface** for real-time control and a **modular backend** for extensibility.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Visual simulation of thread lifecycle
- GUI to start/stop threads dynamically
- Locking and synchronization with visual indicators
- Sample scenarios via `example.py`
- Clean, modular design suitable for educational use
